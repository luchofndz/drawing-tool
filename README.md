# Classkick Front End Engineering Take Home Project

## Intro
Created a drawing app, where user can draw, erase, add text, select color and size for txt or drawing.
Made with Canvas and NextJs.

## Libraries
Added Material UI to not reinvent the wheel, where we have buttons and toggle applied here.
Added icons from flaticon.
Installed Sass to improve adding styles.
Installed and configured Jest for unit testing.

## Requirements:
 - Exhibits SOLID design principles, good application architecture, and project organization.
 - Create components as you feel is best suited for your solution and feel free to use any libraries and explain why you chose those libraries
 - Your app does NOT have to be hooked up to a backend and thus it does NOT have to preserve state. If you do choose to persist state, or even integrate with a backend, it will be considred a bonus. However, you should still stub out the API calls that you would make to persist state.
 - It should be clear in your code and/or documentation on areas for eg:
    - Design/Technical decisions
    - Mocks/stubs a virtual API that could be injected to persist all actions on the canvas remotely (eg: Firebase)
 - Tests!

Just remember: when in doubt, treat this project as though you are about to submit it to your peers for a PR.

## Bonus:
- Make it accessible.
- Make it production ready.
- Stand up a backend in order to persist state.
